Describe MITRE ATT&CK FRAMEWORK and how it applies to 

threat detection

The MITRE ATT&CK Framework is a framework that documents known cyber threats and 

adversaries and displays the tactics, techniques, and procedures that they use. The TTPs that 

threats utilize can be compared and contrasted using the MITRE ATT&CK Navigator tool. The 

MITRE ATT&CK Framework applies to threat detection because it can be used as a tool to find 

known malware and threat actors that target specific sectors like medicine and finance. 

Pick 3 TTPs to discuss and explain

Initial Access | Replication Through Removable Media - ID: T1091. Malware is copied onto 

removable media such as a USB drive which is then connected to the target system. When 

connected to the system Autorun features are used to execute any malicious software on the 

drive. 

Defense Evasion | Indicator Removal - ID: T1070. The deletion or modification of pieces 

evidence of an attackers presence in a system. These pieces of evidence can inclue log files, 

events, etc. 

Exfiltration | Exfiltration Over C2 Channel - ID:T1041. Exfiltration of stolen data over a pre-

existing command and control channel. Data is transferred to a command and control server. 

How are IoCs used in Threat Hunting

Indicators of compromise are any signs that a system may have been attacked or compromised. 

Indicators of compromise are used in Threat Hunting by being a starting point to look for 

possible threats. An IoC such as network traffic anomalies can be used to show signs of 

malicious activity in the network such as data exfiltration.
