Week 2 entry: Basic Wireshark Concepts.

Wireshark lets you filter through captured packets based on protocol, source and destination ip 

address, applications, characteristics, etc.

KEY TAKEAWAYS: 

-Wireshark filters are used to find packets using certain criteria like protocol or source and 

destination IP.

-Turning important filters into buttons can make searching for specific traffic more efficient 

-You can customize packet coloring 

-Turn off checksum error rule because it can show false positives

TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES 

Wireshark

Filtering displayed packets

Editing packet coloring

LAB SUMMARIES

-Use wireshark’s filtering autocomplete to find traffic

-Filter by port number rather than protocol name to get a more complete picture

-Filter displayed packets to just one TCP conversation by right clicking a frame from the target 

conversation and clicking “Conversation Filter | TCP.” Then exporting that single conversation.

REAL-WORLD APPLICATION

Wireshark can be customized to fit the users preferences to make the use of it more 

personalized. Wireshark can be used by network administrators to find what hosts on a network 

are connecting to unauthorized sites. It can be used to detect possible network attacks as well. 

Filters can be used to easily track single conversations and ip addresses.

QUESTIONS OR FUTURE GOALS

Who in a business is authorized and responsible for monitoring network traffic?

I want to learn more situations in which filters can be utilized.
